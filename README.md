# Dria-Node

This is an alternative to installing and running a Dria Node as a service if you donâ€™t want to always open Screen to monitor the logs. However, you can also follow the standard installation tutorial via the following official FirstBatch link :<br> 
https://github.com/firstbatchxyz/dkn-compute-launcher
<br><br>
==========================================<br>

Run & Install the custom script :<br>
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satocxyz/dria-node/main/dria_node.sh | bash
```

Start the node to input required field like Wallet Private Key, Choose Models, and API key

```
dkn-compute-launcher start
```

With a VPS of 8 cores and 20 GB of RAM, I can run the following Ollama models, as well as run all API-level models from Gemini, OpenAI, and OpenRouter.<br><br>

After all done and node start testing the models, press CTRL+C to cancel it

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start dkn-compute-launcher
```
